queersplaygames
===============

The goal of this project is largely to provide a resource for people to discover recources and participate in communities that offer diversity in gender-identity and sexuality. To that end priority will be given to sites/communities with a demonstratable history of active management/participation. However, all legitimate submissions will be considered and added to the issue tracker for eventual inclusion.

Development will mainly occur in the gh-pages branch.
