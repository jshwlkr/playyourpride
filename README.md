# queersplaygames

The goal of this project is largely to provide a resource for people to discover resources and participate in communities that offer inclusivity and welcome diversity in gender-identity and sexuality. To that end priority will be given to sites/communities with a demonstrable history of active management/participation. However, all legitimate submissions will be considered and added to the issue tracker for eventual inclusion. Sites with occasional NSFW content will be considered, sites exclusively serving NSFW content will not.

Development will mainly occur in the `gh-pages` branch.

The site is available via <http://queersplaygames.com> or <http://jshwlkr.github.io/queersplaygames/>.
